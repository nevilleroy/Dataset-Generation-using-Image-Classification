# Dataset Generation Using Image Classification
<ul>
  <li><h2>Overview</h2></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Machine learning is currently at the pinnacle of its popularity. However, many decision-makers are unaware of what is required to build, train, and launch a machine learning algorithm successfully. The data collected must be uniform and coherent such that it can be understood by a machine. A common challenge faced is the maintenance of a gigantic codebase. In the proposed model the dataset is created using web scraping and image classification models that allow the user to define the required data elements for each dataset, comparing each element with a sample image provided by the user. The model compares the similarity scores of the high-level features of the sample image with those scraped from the web. The Web scraping model makes use of tools like selenium that makes use of bots to automate the process of the extraction of web data from the specified websites and store it for later use, thereby delivering faster results by eliminating the requirement of manual data entry and other human errors. The image classification model chosen is a pre-trained convolutional neural network known as mobilenet which extracts the various features of the images. We aim to create a seamless interface that allows users to input the dataset to be generated, enter the number of data elements to be obtained by including sample images and obtain the desired elements, all integrated using a python UI application.</li>
      <li> <h2>Objectives</h2></li>
      <li> I. ML approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used in the most promising modern techniques in this domain. The use of this model will further reduce the total computation power required by performing a lesser number of multiplication operations and utilizing a smaller set of parameters as compared to traditional CNNs<li></li>
      II. Using ML techniques we aim to develop a dataset generation model using state-of-the-art image classification techniques and web scraping tools such as Selenium.<li></li>
      III. The model will be able to generate an image dataset of a user defined size ‘n’.</li>
    </ul>
  <li> <h2>Results</h2></li>
  <ul>
      <li>The proposed dataset generation model will enable users to create datasets as required by the respective ML model in a faster and efficient manner. The model is able to obtain relevant images with high similarity scores for the creation of an effective image dataset. This helps provide a faster mode of delivery by using considerably lesser parameters as compared to traditional CNN’s. The use of this model will further reduce the total computation power required by performing a lesser number of multiplication operations and utilizing a smaller set of parameters. This model can in turn help developers to circumvent the problem of data scarcity and helps automate the process of securing a suitable dataset as required by the user.</li>
